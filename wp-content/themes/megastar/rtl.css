Theme Name: megastar

Adding support for language written in a Right To Left (RTL) direction is easy -
it's just a matter of overwriting all the horizontal positioning attributes
of your CSS stylesheet in a separate stylesheet file named rtl.css.

[Note: base rtl style located in css/rtl-theme.css, css/rtl-woocommerce.css because of less compiler. 
we process all right-to-left direction automatically you don't need to write any code 
for rtl style actually, happy coding!]
